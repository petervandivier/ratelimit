- a root object exists for every object
- an object tree can be arbitrarily large
- a root note must have attributeable limits

for example actor 5
  - ratelimit "A" of 1 / minute
  - quota "B" of 100 / day
    - "B" can be expressed as (0.07 / minute) / day

for limits measured over the same span, take the lesser value
measure all cadidate limits over the appropriate span
